<p>Another slow day in the markets.</p>

<p>Dear Ron,</p>

<p>My name is Andrei Sota, and I am an individual investor located in Romania. During the past couple of years I have researched systemic and algorithmic trading and built a nice track record for myself. I have begun to generate some interest from my close circle of contacts and I started to think about establishing a fund so we could pool our investments and maybe gain traction with some other large institutions down the line. From my own legal research, here&#39;s what I understand when it comes down to setting up a fund (if you could kindly confirm):</p>

<p>A partnership or LLC with less than 100 persons can be set up so that it is exempt from registering as an investment company. As long as there are fewer than 15 US persons involved (or less than $25M belonging to US persons), the fund&#39;s manager (myself in this case) is exempt from registering with the SEC - so much is clear from your presentation. Basically the law states that as long as the manager is not based in the US and the fund doesn&#39;t count US clients, it falls out of its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>US law does not obligate the fund to have a third party auditor, from what I understand.</p>

<p>When it comes to marketing a US fund managed by a EU resident to EU clients, I understand that the easiest way is to use &quot;reverse solicitation&quot; and clearly establish that this is the case. </p>

<p>I am aiming to proceed with the simplest way to form a fund, and would initially prefer a stand alone domestic structure on which to build later on. I will be doing pro bono management and for the foreseeable future I am not planing to earn a management fee from my clients. This project is simply aimed at getting them acquainted to investing in the stock market along with me (pooling our funds) and doing so in a clean, legal way. If any other investors would like to join down the road, the firm would already be established and would facilitate an easier onboarding process.</p>

<p>The obvious problem that I am facing is the initial amounts that individuals will be willing to put up - I don&#39;t realistically think I will be able to fundraise more than $500.000. I am aware this amount is microscopic. However, what would be the alternative? That I am loaned this amount and trade as an individual investor? I&#39;m not comfortable taking a loan of this size either. That&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for other means of doing this business. I am also open to the possibility that this endeavor is not possible given these circumstances, so if that is your opinion, please be frank about it.</p>
